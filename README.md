# HousePrices
From our analysis we can see that the capital clearly has the most expensive property prices. 
On closer inspection the further north the city the more likey it is to have lower property value. We can see this in heat map generated on Power BI. Properties in the south are more expensive than the north and have a close proximity to London also seems to boost housing prices.

Furthermore we can see huge dips in the sales of properties since 1995. 
There a 3 dips: 
- 1:1999 - 2001 
- 2:2007 - 2008 
- 3:2021 - present

Reason for the dips:
- 1999 - 2001 :  During th 90's there was a recession. During this period of economic downturn, interest rates were raised to 15% and left in place to control inflation. House price fell by 20% from 89-93. The market started to recover during the late 90's, where we start seeing increase in property prices.

- 2007 - 2008 : This one is quite obvious, it has to be the infamous global financial crisis triggered by the collapse of the US housing market. The crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including reckless lending by banks and the widespread use of subprime mortgages. Many homeowner started to face negative equiy where the value of their home is less than the outstanding mortgage.

- 2021 - present : Causeed mainly by the increase in interest rates in the UK, with no real salary increases to keep up with inflation, meaning ordinary working class people cannot afford a loan to buy a house.
